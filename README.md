🏠 Safety and peace of mind are paramount, especially when it comes to arriving home safely. That's why I'm developing an app that aims to ensure individuals feel secure when they arrive at their destination.

📱 Here's how it works: When users arrive home, they simply send a text message to a friend or loved one to let them know they've arrived safely. But here's the twist: if the user doesn't provide proof of arrival—such as a live photo or video—the app triggers an alarm to remind them. This ensures that even in hectic moments, users can stay connected and feel secure.

💡 I'm starting with a basic prototype to test the core functionality, which includes simulating the text exchange, capturing proof of arrival, and triggering an alarm if needed. From there, I'll iterate and expand the app's features based on feedback and user needs.

🔍 I believe in the power of technology to enhance safety and peace of mind, and I'm excited to see how this project evolves!

🚧 Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and refine the "Text me right when you get home" app. Your feedback and support are invaluable as I work to make this idea a reality!
